# Gilded Rose Kata

My poor attempt at the [Gilded Rose Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata). I did this back in April 2022 and had no knowledge of rust. Additionally, I had some caveats such as:
- Not being able to change the original `Item` struct. This means the `Item` struct had to be named `Item` and had to remain a struct.
- Having to use a factory-style method for updating the quality of the items.
